# SQL Injection Challenge

A simple SQL injection challenge.
I have create it to understand better Docker.

Donwload the repository and move into this folder.
Then run `docker compose up`.

Move into the web app at http://127.0.0.1:8000 . Here you can create accounts and try to log in. If you get in you'll see *Welcome \<USERNAME\>*.

The challenge is very easy.

You can also access in PHPMyAdmin, just type in your web browser http://127.0.0.1:8080 . The credential you'll find on *docker-compose.yml*.
